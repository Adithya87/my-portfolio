# Contact Form Setup Guide

Your portfolio now has a fully functional contact form with multiple backend options. Here's how to set it up:

## Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io)**
2. **Sign up for a free account**
3. **Create a new form:**
   - Click "New Form"
   - Enter your email address (where you want to receive messages)
   - Copy the form endpoint (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/xpwznqnz`)
4. **Update the form action in your HTML:**
   - Find line ~2572 in `portfolio.html`
   - Replace `xpwznqnz` with your actual Formspree form ID
   - Example: `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"`

**That's it! Your form will now work immediately.**

## Option 2: EmailJS (Backup Method)

1. **Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com)**
2. **Create a free account**
3. **Set up email service:**
   - Add your email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Note the Service ID
4. **Create email template:**
   - Create a template with variables: `{{from_name}}`, `{{from_email}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{message}}`
   - Note the Template ID
5. **Get your User ID from EmailJS dashboard**
6. **Update the JavaScript in your HTML:**
   - Find the EmailJS section in the contact form JavaScript
   - Replace placeholders with your actual IDs:
     ```javascript
     service_id: 'your_service_id',
     template_id: 'your_template_id',
     user_id: 'your_user_id'
     ```

## Option 3: Netlify Forms (If hosting on Netlify)

1. **Add `netlify` attribute to your form:**
   ```html
   <form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" netlify></form>
   ```
2. **Deploy to Netlify - forms will work automatically**
